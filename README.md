# Secure-CLI

Secure CLI Project is a Python script that remotely receive information from a client and saves them as a JSON file.
This project was built as part of my Advanced Network & Security System class.

If you wanna run both client and server in one machine leave the IP address as "localhost". To connect from a remote machine, 
adjust the IP on the server file to match the interface you want the server to bind, on the client file, adjust the IP to be the
same as the one the server is binding into. 

This code works over LAN and WANs, I have not tried yet using public addresses.
